Next step being data analysis and visualization, where we analyzed our data distribution as univariate, bivariate and multivariate plots. Multicollinearity check was performed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 2 - We performed 3 hypothesis testing one comparing means for two variavles using T-test , second was asssociation of target age and country using chi_square test, last was asssociation of target age and duration using chi_square test.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 3 - Presence of null values would have created possible errors in the further steps, so we replaced few values with null, few with the word \"unknown\" few were dropped.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 4 - As a part of feature engineering we have done textual data processing which includes:expand contraction, lower casing, removing punctuations and stopwords, normalization,and vectoriztion. We performed data scaling using standardscalar, and dimensionality reduction using PCA.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 5 - Last step was to perform clustering using different algorithms, we tried K-Means, ElbowCurve, DBSCAN, Dendogram, Agglomerative Clustering. Recommendation system function was also developed."
