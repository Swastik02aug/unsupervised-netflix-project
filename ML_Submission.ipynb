The streaming service's number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled.

Next step being data analysis and visualization, where we analyzed our data distribution as univariate, bivariate and multivariate plots. Multicollinearity check was performed.\n",
        "\n",

        "Step 3 - Presence of null values would have created possible errors in the further steps, so we replaced few values with null, few with the word \"unknown\" few were dropped.\n",

        "Step 4 - As a part of feature engineering we have done textual data processing which includes:expand contraction, lower casing, removing punctuations and stopwords, normalization,and vectoriztion. We performed data scaling using standardscalar, and dimensionality reduction using PCA.\n",
        "\n",
        "Step 5 - Last step was to perform clustering using different algorithms, we tried K-Means, ElbowCurve, DBSCAN, Dendogram, Agglomerative Clustering. Recommendation system function was also developed."
